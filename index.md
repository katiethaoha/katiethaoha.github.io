Several methods of converting data from one raw form to another format are applied to organize the unruly datasets from @weratedog twitter account for better consumption. The dataset includes 2000+ tweets and images from multiple sources. Data collection, data cleaning, quality and tidiness issues are resolved using Python for final accurate analysis and visualization.

The analysis is focus on telling a story about Boston's violent crimes from the year 2015 to date based on Boston public crime data. Besides, we also build up a model to predict the shooting probability so that whenever Boston Polices encounter a lawbreaking event, they are well prepared to prevent more serious crimes that involved with gun use.


### Suicide Analysis - Predict Suicide Rate using Machine Learning Models with R and Tableau

Suicide rates has been a worrying trends all over U.S. Social economic change, mental health issues, environment or historical factors could be part of the puzzle. Over the dataset provided by Kaggle, we aim to reveal the root causes of increasing trend in suicide among all age ranges, social economic groups, and ethnic groups. Linear regression model, gradient boosting, and random forest have been using to arrive at the highest accuracy model in predicting suicide rates.

I'm using R and its graphic package `ggplot` to perform exploratory data analysis on Prosper Loan financial dataset. The primary purpose is to explore relationships from single variable to multiple variables considering its distributions, outliers, and derive significant insights for better finanical understanding.
